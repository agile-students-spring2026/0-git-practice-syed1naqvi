## Interesting Article on Software Engineering
 Rogelberg, Sasha. [“Experienced Software Developers Assumed AI Would Save Them a Chunk of Time. But in One Experiment, Their Tasks Took 20% Longer.”](https://fortune.com/article/does-ai-increase-workplace-productivity-experiment-software-developers-task-took-longer/) FORTUNE, 5 Jan. 2026.

## Remarks
This article is about an experiment in which 16 software developers with an average of five years of experience were assigned 246 tasks to complete with the use of Artificial Intelligence. The outcome of this test was that it took the software developers about 20% longer to complete their tasks than usual. The main reason behind this was that while the AI's work was very useful, the developers had to spend a lot of time cleaning the code that was generated.

This makes me wonder about the future of AI code generation. Was their time lost due to a matter of how they wrote their prompt? Will writing very accurate prompts be considered as an important skillset in the future? Does AI have a diminishing return overtime due to human errors or logistics?

 What interested me most was that the AI didn't make experienced developers faster; instead, it made them slower because they had to spend time asking, waiting, and then cleaning up or rewriting output that didn't fit the project's needs. It's an excellent reminder that "AI = productivity" doesn't always work. If you already have a lot going on, an assistant can actually add to your work.
